#Using functions seq(), assign(), min(), max(), c(), sort(), sum(), filter()

#1. Set up a vector named age consisting of 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27, 22, 37,
#34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24, 33, 41.

length(age)

#b.Write the R code and its output.

#2.Find the reciprocal of the values for age.
#Write the R code and its output.

#5. Find the minimum and maximum value for age.
#Write the R code and its output.
min(age)
